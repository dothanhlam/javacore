Interface

    A class can implement multiple interfaces
    An interface cannot provide any code at all
    An interface can only define public static final constants
    An interface cannot define instance variables
    Adding a new method has ripple effects on implementing classes (design maintenance)
    JAXB cannot deal with interfaces
    An interface cannot extends or implement an abstract class
    All interface methods are public

In general, interfaces should be used to define contracts
(what is to be achieved, not how to achieve it).

Abstract Class

    A class can extend at most one abstract class
    An abstract class can contain code
    An abstract class can define both static and instance constants (final)
    An abstract class can define instance variables
    Modification of existing abstract class code has ripple effects on extending classes (implementation maintenance)
    Adding a new method to an abstract class has no ripple effect on extending classes
    An abstract class can implement an interface
    Abstract classes can implement private and protected methods

Abstract classes should be used for (partial) implementation.
They can be a mean to restrain the way API contracts should be implemented.

- Abstract class is one which can't be instantiated, ie. its object canNOT be created.

- Abstract method are method's declaration without its defination.

- A Non-abstract class can only have Non-abstract methods.

- An Abstract class can have both the Non-abstract as well as Abstract methods.

- If the Class has an Abstract method then the class must also be Abstract.

- An Abstract method must be implemented by the very first Non-Abstract sub-class.

- Abstract class in Design patterns are used to encapsulate the behaviors that keeps changing.
